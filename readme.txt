A function providing a tag cloud like view of monthly archives.

== Description ==

With Chrono Cloud you will be able to add a third cloud to your archives page: A cloud based on time.

Just as categories can be viewed as a tag cloud through the use if the `taxonomy=category` argument to
the `wp_tag_cloud` function, this plugin provides a similar functionality, displaying each month with posts as
a tag in a cloud.

Example usage in e.g. `archives.php`:

`<?php chrono_cloud_echo(); ?>`

== Installation ==

1. Download Plugin .zip-file.
1. Unzip and upload to the plugin directory, usually at `wp-content/plugins/`.
1. Activate the plugin from the WordPress "Plugin" administration screen.
1. Add a line like `<?php chrono_cloud_echo(); ?>` somewhere in your theme files, preferably in the `archives.php` file.
